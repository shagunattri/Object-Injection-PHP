## PHP Object Injection ðŸ’‰

The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP function. Since PHP allows object serialization, attackers could pass ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the application scope.

## Deserialization ðŸ§‡
As PHP allows for object serialization attackers could pass serialised string into in unserialize() call allowing for malicious attack.

This repository explains one such execution of PHP Object Injection.
